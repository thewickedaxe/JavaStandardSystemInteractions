# Java Standard System Interactions

## This is a small library meant to ease 3 main things

1. Writing to and reading from the console shouldn't be so complicated.

2. Executing runtime commands and running system processes should not be such a pain in Java.

3. Writing and reading to files should be a lot simpler in Java.

This package solves these problems by providing neat little portable helper classers that will work almost anywhere. 

This project uses Maven. I feel the project has pretty neat javadoc

## Todo:
1. Write unit tests

2. Enable checkstyle and static code analysis

3. Set up a proper continuous deployment pipeline

4. Improve javadoc

5. Clean up exception handling
