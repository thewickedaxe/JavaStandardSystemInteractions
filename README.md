# Java Standard System Interactions

This is a small library meant to ease 3 main things

1. Writing to and reading from the console shouldn't be so complicated.

2. Executing runtime commands and running system processes should not be such a pain in Java.

3. Writing and reading to files should be a lot simpler in Java.

This package solves these problems by providing neat little portable helper classers that will work almost anywhere. 

This project uses Maven. I feel the project has pretty neat javadoc

Todo:
1. Write unit tests
2. Enable findbugs and checkstyle
3. Start giving buildable jars
3. Improve javadoc
