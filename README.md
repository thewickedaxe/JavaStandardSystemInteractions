# Java Standard System Interactions

This is a small library meant to ease 3 main things

1. Writing to and reading from the console shouldn't be so complicated.

2. Executing runtime commands and running system processes should not be such a pain in Java.

3. Writing and reading to files should be a lot simpler in Java.

This package solves these problems by providing neat little portable helper classers that will work almost anywhere.

This project uses Maven. I feel the project has pretty neat javadoc

If you want to build the source just run "ant build" on the now ready build xml. It will build it for you and package required libraries into the jar so that you don't have to.

Todo:
1. Write unit tests

2. Enable checkstyle and static code analysis

3. Set up a proper continuous deployment pipeline

4. Improve javadoc

5. Clean up exception handling
